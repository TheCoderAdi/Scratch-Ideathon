# Scratch-Ideathon
It is the idea for the Scratch-Ideathon event .


### Introduction
I wanted to reach out to you to share my thoughts on an issue that I think is important.
Now-a-days development is doing a great thing . Everyones dream is becoming a great programmer . So they are watching tutorials from youtube , some paid course and etc.
Here a term comes that tutorial hell , It is a  very bad thing that you only wathcing tutorial and when you are sitting to code anything your hands stops to move in the keyboard.
Furthermore, relying too heavily on tutorials can lead to a lack of creativity and originality. It's important to have the confidence and independence to try new things and come up with your own solutions.

### My Solution
One solution to help beginners avoid the "tutorial hell" is to create a website that provides a comprehensive and structured learning experience. This website could include interactive lessons, quizzes, and projects that guide users through the process of building a website from scratch to finish. We also make a community where the beginner should ask there  query , share their progress and get feedback from the experienced developers.
I know that a beginner don't do anything for free , because if it is free and we are not giving them any reward then they will stop there coding and will not consistently doing coding . So our website will give some rewards affer finishing a project that encourage the user to do another project . So , in this way we will built a strong community of programmers.
